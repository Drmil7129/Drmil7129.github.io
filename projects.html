			<h2>Kitty Cat Identifier</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/Drmil7129/kitty_cat_identifier">Github repo here</a>
			<h3>In this project I used my knowledge of Weka from my Artificial Intelligence module at university to create a machine learning prediction model that identifies a cat's breed given an image. 
				It was trained on over 40,000+ different images and has an ~80% correct classification rate.

			<h2>Speedmates</h2>
			<h3>This was a team project coursework that involved the planning and development of a fully functional website that was to solve any problem related to university students. 
				We chose to create a matching service for housemates. The project spanned several months involving great team coordination. We used many collobartive tools such as github kanban boards to break up tasks into tickets.
				Set up weekly meetings and communnication channels to ensure everyone is kept up to date with any changes.
				The frontend was created using HTML and TypeScript whilst the backend was created in Java with SpringBoot.

			<h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>
			<h3>Here I attempted to prepare for my Intelligent Robotics course and combine the software developing skills I have built over my academincs years and my basic understanding of electronics and physical engineering, coming from A-Level Physics or extracuricalur hobbies.
				My goal was to create an extended hing for a door, that would automatically cause the door to close after a short duration from being opened.
				I researched the physical hardware I would need, such as a motor driver and a small machine to run the program on.
				The program was to be built in python.
