	<h1>Who am I?</h1>
	<h3>I am a Computer Science student studying at the University of Birmingham looking to secure a placement in industry to learn more about the fields I am passionate about and use the skills I learn for my future career and to explore my passions further.
		Some of my current areas of interest include Cyber Security, Robotics and Data Science. I thoroughly enjoyed the Security and Networks module in my course, especially the coursework which contained finding and exploiting vulnerabilties in a website, it opened my eyes to potential roles in Cyber Security such as ethical hacking which is something I would enjoy and pursue in the future.
		I have always had interests about the physical side of Computer Science, I have built my own PCs before and used Raspberry Pi to create simple machines before and have many other personal goals I would like to explore. The Robotics module at my University is also another way I act out my passion. A role in Robotics or Physical Manucfacturing/Engineering would be allow me to act on this passion and give me the neccessary skills to achieve some personal goals of mine, such as building a machine starting with some rocks.
